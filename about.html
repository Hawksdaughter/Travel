        <p class="aboutMe">Hello there! ­ЪЉІ My name is Myra.  It's pronounced the way it's spelled, as if you are saying "My Egyptian god."  I have lived in several locales in my life, including having been a Zonian when I was a young child. I currently live in the southeastern farmland of the Puget Sound Area of Washington state (i.e. Pierce County).</p>

        <p class="aboutMe">  My college degree basically prepared graduates to work outdoors in the field doing things like radio-tracking wild animals or monitoring the impacts of logging on Forest Service land.  The volunteer work I did  at raptor centers and zoos before graduation often involved teaching wild animal life history information. After receiving my degree, that experience quickly led to paid jobs educating the public about raptors, and I was able to extrapolate that over to educating about various other trained wild animals. I pivoted very quickly into husbandry care of animals in the education departments at zoological facilities. In the final phase of that career, a priceless opportunity to learn animal training techniques with marine mammals led me down an even more specialized path -- training education animals for educational zoo stage shows. During my career with wildlife, I cared for and trained a huge variety of different species (everything from insects to domesticated animals), but the ones I gained the most experience with were marine mammals and birds of prey.</p>

        <p class="aboutMe"> Five and a half years ago, life forced me to find a temporary job of driving city buses, which became a more permanent job.  I worked evenings, but it was nice for the first time in my life to have a Monday to Friday job with major holidays off.  During the height of the pandemic, there was no change at all in my daily work routine except for none of the middle class commuters riding the bus anymore, more violence at work, and a dramatically sharp increase in passengers abusing opiods while onboard.</p>

        <p class="aboutMe">Several aspects of coding have always interested me, and I have been finding that my adaptability skills are well-suited for it!  I am excited to have stepped onto this learning path, and I look forward to a new career in tech!</p>
